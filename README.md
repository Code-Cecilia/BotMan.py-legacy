# BotMan

A discord bot written by [Mahasvan](https://github.com/Mahas1) in python using the library [Discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html#)
Don't use my code without crediting. You are free to host it and fork it yourself but don't claim any of my code as yours.

# Usage and installation

Download the repo as zip or do the following below in a terminal window:

```bash
sudo apt-get install git
git clone https://github.com/Code-Cecilia/BotMan.py
``` 
`cd` into the project's directory and run this command
```bash
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Get to the [developer page](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and make a new application.

![new application](./images/new_application.png)

![name the app](./images/name_app.png)

![add bot](./images/add_bot.png)

![copy token](./images/copy_token.png)

 Now that you have copied your token, paste it in `config.json` in its corresponding entry.

A properly set-up config.json looks something like this

```json
{
  "prefix_list": ["bm-", "Bm-", "$"],
  "main_prefix": "bm-",
  "token": "ODQ4NTI5xxxxx._cvTBeEHbk1z6iTtCHY92TFN5DU",
  "status_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ",
  "bio": "Hello! I am Botman, a bot written in Python by Mahasvan Mohan (github: Mahas1). \nI am open-source, and the source code for me can be viewed and downloaded here. Feel free to check it out!\nhttps://github.com/Mahas1/BotMan.py/"
}
```

# Setting up Reddit details

You're gonna need to setup an application for proper functioning of the Reddit Cog.

Go to [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com), and make a new account (or use the one you have). I don't think it matters.

The first step you need to do is turn on dark mode, because that's what cool people do ðŸ˜Ž (it's sarcasm)

Now go to the [Reddit Applications page](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps/) 

If you already have an app, you'd see something like this

![reddit app page](./images/make_reddit_app.png)

If you don't have an app already, you'd see something like "Create an app"

What you need to do now, is to enter these details

 - Name - Enter a name for your application
 - Choose the `script` checkbox
 - set `about url` and `redirect url` as `https://localhost:8080` (if you know what you're doing, feel free to mess around.)
 - Click on `Create app`

![filling in the details](./images/filling_reddit_app_details.png)

Now, you'd see an entry for your application **above** the portion of the screen where you entered the details. (weird, I know.)

You can get the Client ID and Client Secret from these entries

![client id and secret](./images/getting_id_secret.png)

Fill in the details for your reddit appication in `reddit_details.json`.
 - `client_id` is the Client ID we got from the application (the one under the application name in the above screenshot)
 - `client_secret` is the Client Secret we got from the entry called `secret`
 - `username` is the username of the Reddit account you used to make the application
 - `password` is the password of the Reddit account you used to make the application

A properly set-up `reddit_details.json` looks something like this.

```json
{
  "client_id" : "E3RXXXXXXXjlKzOg",
  "client_secret": "nEdXXXXXXXXXS_9tBYyo1Q",
  "username": "PrawBot12345",
  "password": "Praw1234"
}
```
(don't worry, the password is wrong)

And that should be it.
You can run `main.py` to run the bot. I'm working on a startup file, so bear with me till I finish it.
